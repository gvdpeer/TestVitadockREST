Hi,

I started a (very) simple test program to work with the Vitadock REST API: visit https://github.com/gvdpeer/TestVitadockREST
The test program can currently login and request the OAuth tokens (success).
The next call to request an activity tracker count fails (unauthorized).
At this moment I don't see what I do wrong here.

The idea is to build a simple .NET lib to perform simple REST requests on the Vitadock API. 
Please feel free to help/build/correct this first solution and turn this into a .NET API lib for Vitadock access.

Thanks in advance, 
Geert.
